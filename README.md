Enummer is a lightweight answer for adding enums with multiple values to Rails, with a similar syntax to Rails' built-in `enum`. It officially supports only PostgreSQL and recent Rails versions because I don't really care about anything else, but PRs are welcome.

## Installation
Add `gem "enummer"` to your Gemfile and `bundle`.

## Usage
Create a migration for a bitstring that looks something like this:

```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.column :permissions, "bit(8)"
    end
  end
end
```

Now set up enummer with the available values in your model:

```ruby
enummer permissions: %i[read write execute]
```

Note that the limit is currently **required** â€” do not use variable bit fields. 1 bit gets you 1 option.

*TODO*: a generator. Because.

## Usage outside of Rails

## Contributing
